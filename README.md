# Colorlib-Courses-Clone-A-Responsive-Website

This is a clone of the Colorlib Courses website, I created a replica of Colorlib Courses using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
Colorlib Courses is a beautifully designed website that showcases various online courses.
The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
The code is organized and structured using best practices, making it easy to understand and maintain. 
The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. This means it can be easily accessed and viewed online.
